Lemur4Bitwig Template .1 Up (Beta6)
===========



Next round for the new Lemur4Bitwig template. This time we got a brand new cliplauncher made in a unified Bitwig design
based on canvas. Due to the team up with <a href="https://github.com/csvance/Lemur4Bitwig">Voice303</a>, who is kindly lemurizing the <a href="https://github.com/git-moss/OSC4Bitwig">OSC4Bitwig</a> script by <a href="http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/Bitwig/Bitwig.html">Moss</a> and shares
his skills on canvas for us, we will see further objects coming. There is also a new XY performance page and 
a new virtual keyboard page, with several additions like Modwheel/Pitchbend/Breath/Expression and After Touch control and a few user request to the device page.</p>




===========

Current features:

1.  Mixer page, with track & master volume faders, transport, track/bank selection, mute/solo/rec, crossfades, tempo,
    track activation, panel modes, arranger modes, mixer modes, add tracks, metronome
2.  Device page, device/common/user/direct/sends mode, load preset- /category- and creator switch, vst open/close
3.  Totally new Clip Launcher page!
5.  Pad page, 16x Drum Pads
6.  Keys page, Modwheel/Pitchbend/Breath/Expression/After Touch with friction and tension control using Lemur physics
7.  X/Y page, now with Lemur physics control and special note pads
8.  New Actions on the Mixer Page - Save/Restart/Undo/Redo/Toggle Trackbank
9.  Toggle Trackbank lets you switch from Audio/Instrument control to FX Track control
10. Tracknames now show up on the device page
11. On the Keyboard we now have visual feedback of the notes that are played back - select a track and a clip, draw some 
    notes in it - start playback and enjoy the show!
