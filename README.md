Lemur Controller Script v. 1

===========

This script is fully based on the touchOSC controller script by Thomas Helzle (http://www.screendream.de/)
from Bitwig, thanks for that!
The Datamanager.js is done by Drew Meyer  http://www.sub-version.net ,thanks for that!

It is supposed to provide nice functionality with Bitwig Studio 1.0.13.
According to new updates from Bitwig, this script will also be updated and extended.

===========

Current features:

1. Mixer page, with track & master volume faders, panorama control and transport.
2. Macro control page, control 8 macros with device selection, preset- /category- / and creatorswitch.
3. Map page, control 8 parameter of a device, with map selection and track- / devicechange.
4. Clip Launcher page, control bank with 5x8 selector and navigation.
5. Pad page, 16x Drum Pads, with transport-> Bitwig style. :)
6. Keys page, simple keys with transpose.
7. X/Y page, 4x X/Y pad for various applications.

===========

To be done:

1. getting datamanager.js to work proper for updateing clip colors and names.
2. setting up a new step sequencer page.
3. setting up canvas objects for leveling meter in mixing page.
4. making use of the physics engine in lemur with the help of user softcore.
5. hopefully a waveform display for the macro and map pages.
6. various visual eye candy improvements.


have fun!
