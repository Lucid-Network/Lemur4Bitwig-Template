Lemur Controller Script .1 Up (Beta2)

===========

Good Times for everyone using my template so far, Moss (push4Bitwig) took over the scripting part for my Lemur template
with the OSC4Bitwig control script. Now we work together to build up on this.
Make sure to grab his script over at his GitHub repo.
The template is not fully supporting every single feature that is already available in the script, but it will soon.

===========

Current features:

1. Mixer page, with track & master volume faders, panorama control and transport.
2. Macro control page, control 8 macros with device selection, preset- /category- / and creatorswitch.
3. Map page, control 8 parameter of a device, with map selection and track- / devicechange.
4. Clip Launcher page, control bank with 5x8 selector and navigation.
5. Pad page, 16x Drum Pads, with transport-> Bitwig style. :)
6. Keys page, simple keys with transpose.
7. X/Y page, 4x X/Y pad for various applications.
8. and a lot more

===========

To be done:

1. implementing full kinda push functionality
2. Nexus resolution support
3. finalizing everything
4. improve on that :)


have fun!

cheers Mark
